# The effiecient rota

Preparing the optimal coverage of hourly paid staff for any events, shifts, projects or particular tasks is a combination of 
best assumptions for the amount of workload and the scheduling of workforce with the appropriate knowledge and experience.

Therefore technology assisting this process can:
 - deliver better sales or results otherwise by avoiding understaffing
 - deliver cost savings by eliminating overstaffing
 - improve outcome by making sure proper knowledge is always present
 - save time for managers planning their rota and preparing their staff schedule
 - streamline communications of schedules and minimize misinformation, miscummunication and misunderstandings
 - reduce administration costs and time spent on payroll and time & attendance reporting
 - evaluate, follow up and further optimize efficiency
 - provide benchmarking

Most online tools that aim to help managers in this area focus on the scheduling part, while only a few include solution for the planning part.

On the other hand, potential users either prepare rotas manually or use some sort of tools, but mostly spreadsheets with or without planning and evaluation features.

The aim of CUBE Rota is to fill this gap and provide an easy-to-use planning **and** scheduling tool for stand-alone stores/coffee shops/restaurants/caterers 
or multi-unit operators either in retail or hospitality.

## UX

This website is for **operations managers** of retail networks, hotels or catering companies as well as for **store/restaurant managers**, recruitment **agencies** and **caterers**.

~~**As a user type, I want to perform an action, so that I can achieve a goal.**~~

- As a Retail Operations Manager of a network of 100 stores I'd like to reduce my labour costs while maintaining or improving sales results and customer satisfaction. 
- As the manager of an artisian coffee shop, I want to schedule enough people for th emorning peak periords while keeping my labour costs under control
- As a manager at a recruitment agency, I want to reduce the time needed to prepare all the schedules as well as switch the administration from paper to electronic and eliminate manual work.
- As a caterer, I want to  use a single platform to allocate proper labour force for my functions and communicate the shift details to staff in a documented way, making sure all of them are aware of and confirm the detailsof their shifts.

As part of the design process I created mockups using the trial version of Balsamiq Cloud:
- [The main page](https://github.com/Sarosim/my-first-website/Documents/Home.png)
- [Industries page](https://github.com/Sarosim/my-first-website/Documents/Industries.png)
- [Features page](https://github.com/Sarosim/my-first-website/Documents/Features.png)
- [Pricing page](https://github.com/Sarosim/my-first-website/Documents/Pricing.png)
- [Login page](https://github.com/Sarosim/my-first-website/Documents/LogIn.png)
- [Sign up form page](https://github.com/Sarosim/my-first-website/Documents/Signup.png)
- [Booking a demo page](https://github.com/Sarosim/my-first-website/Documents/BookaDemo.png)

_The mockups contain a message indicator in the navbar, although later I decided not to include it in the production, because that is a feature for users already logged in._

I used mobile first approach as these pages can serve as landing pages for future advertisements, most of the features (to be developped later) will need desktop first approach,
as they are too complex to use on mobile and the users are office based.

As a landing page, the most important goals are to convey the message why this is good for the operations manager, the store manager, the caterer or the manager of an agency **and** to be eye-cathing, visually appealing.

Pictures are telling 1000 words, so I choose a picture with a diary, a desk, a pen and a phone to generate the impression of **office work**, **scheduling** and **communication**. The picture is from Pixabay, where it is available *Free for commercial use 
No attribution required.*

The headline message tells:
- "Cost effective" - so you can save money
- "Plan your rota and Schedule your staff" - clearly stetes what it does.
 
Further indications of what, why, for whom are included on the home page, supported by showing the logos of and quoting existing happy users.<br> 
Links to more detailed explanations of the features, benefits and industry specifics are organized on separate pages, with links from the main page.<br>
At any given point, the user exactly knows how they can learn more and what actions can be taken (how they can start using the system or contact someone). 

## Features
