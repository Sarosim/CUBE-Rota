# The effiecient rota

Preparing the optimal coverage of hourly paid staff for any events, shifts, projects or particular tasks is a combination of 
best assumptions for the amount of workload and the scheduling of workforce with the appropriate knowledge and experience.

Therefore technology assisting this process can:
 - deliver better sales or results otherwise by avoiding understaffing
 - deliver cost savings by eliminating overstaffing
 - improve outcome by making sure proper knowledge is always present
 - save time for managers planning their rota and preparing their staff schedule
 - streamline communications of schedules and minimize misinformation, miscummunication and misunderstandings
 - reduce administration costs and time spent on payroll and time & attendance reporting
 - evaluate, follow up and further optimize efficiency
 - provide benchmarking

Most online tools that aim to help managers in this area focus on the scheduling part, while only a few include solution for the planning part.

On the other hand, potential users either prepare rotas manually or use some sort of tools, but mostly spreadsheets with or without planning and evaluation features.

The aim of CUBE Rota is to fill this gap and provide an easy-to-use planning **and** scheduling tool for stand-alone stores/coffee shops/restaurants/caterers 
or multi-unit operators either in retail or hospitality.
