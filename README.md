# The effiecient rota

Preparing the optimal coverage of hourly paid staff for any events, shifts, projects or particular tasks is a combination of 
best assumptions for the amount of workload and the scheduling of workforce with the appropriate knowledge and experience.

Therefore technology assisting this process can:
 - deliver better sales or results otherwise by avoiding understaffing
 - deliver cost savings by eliminating overstaffing
 - improve outcome by making sure proper knowledge is always present
 - save time for managers planning their rota and preparing their staff schedule
 - streamline communications of schedules and minimize misinformation, miscummunication and misunderstandings
 - reduce administration costs and time spent on payroll and time & attendance reporting
 - evaluate, follow up and further optimize efficiency
 - provide benchmarking

Most online tools that aim to help managers in this area focus on the scheduling part, while only a few include solution for the planning part.

On the other hand, potential users either prepare rotas manually or use some sort of tools, but mostly spreadsheets with or without planning and evaluation features.

The aim of CUBE Rota is to fill this gap and provide an easy-to-use planning **and** scheduling tool for stand-alone stores/coffee shops/restaurants/caterers 
or multi-unit operators either in retail or hospitality.

## UX

This website is for **operations managers** of retail networks, hotels or catering companies as well as for **store/restaurant managers**, recruitment **agencies** and **caterers**.

- As a Retail Operations Manager of a network of 100 stores I'd like to reduce my labour costs while maintaining or improving sales results and customer satisfaction. 
- As the manager of an artisian coffee shop, I want to schedule enough people for th emorning peak periords while keeping my labour costs under control
- As a manager at a recruitment agency, I want to reduce the time needed to prepare all the schedules as well as switch the administration from paper to electronic and eliminate manual work.
- As a caterer, I want to  use a single platform to allocate proper labour force for my functions and communicate the shift details to staff in a documented way, making sure all of them are aware of and confirm the detailsof their shifts.

As part of the design process I created mockups using the trial version of Balsamiq Cloud:
- [The main page](https://github.com/Sarosim/CUBE-Rota/blob/master/assets/Documents/Home.png)
- [Industries page](https://github.com/Sarosim/CUBE-Rota/blob/master/assets/Documents/Industries.png)
- [Features page](https://github.com/Sarosim/CUBE-Rota/blob/master/assets/Documents/Features.png)
- [Pricing page](https://github.com/Sarosim/CUBE-Rota/blob/master/assets/Documents/Pricing.png)
- [Login page](https://github.com/Sarosim/my-first-website/Documents/LogIn.png)
- [Sign up form page](https://github.com/Sarosim/CUBE-Rota/blob/master/assets/Documents/Signup.png)
- [Booking a demo page](https://github.com/Sarosim/CUBE-Rota/blob/master/assets/Documents/BookaDemo.png)

_The mockups contain a message indicator in the navbar, although I later decided not to include it in the production, because that is a feature for users already logged in._

I used mobile first approach as these pages can serve as landing pages for future advertisements, most of the features (to be developped later) will need desktop first approach,
as they are too complex to use on mobile and the users are office based.

As a landing page, the most important goals are to convey the message why this is good for the operations manager, the store manager, the caterer or the manager of an agency **and** to be eye-cathing, visually appealing.

Pictures are telling 1000 words, so I choose a picture with a diary, a desk, a pen and a phone to generate the impression of **office work**, **scheduling** and **communication**. 
The picture is from Pixabay, where it is available *Free for commercial use No attribution required.*

The headline message tells:
- "Cost effective" - so you can save money
- "Plan your rota and Schedule your staff" - clearly stetes what it does.

Further indications of 'what', 'why' and 'for whom' are included on the home page, supported by showing the logos of and quoting existing happy users.<br> 
Links to more detailed explanations of the features, benefits and industry specifics are organized on separate pages, with links from the main page.<br>
At any given point, the user exactly knows how they can learn more and what actions can be taken (how they can start using the system or contact someone). 

In order to visually differentiate sections, the font colour of the jumbotron is used as background colour for the section right underneath it, 
while using its complementer colour to create maximum visibility and harmony. The font colour and the background colour are alternated for the following sections to clearly differentiate them. 

The background image of the index page is used for the login, sign in and demo requesting pages to keep consistency and minimise file size, although the forms are placed on a less transparent background to make them pop up.

The primary market for the site is London - where the proportion of staff with English as a second language is relatively high in retail and hospitalty - therefore providing language options for the potential users is essential. It also serves the future aim of opening for overseas businesses.

## Features

### Existing Features

#### Explanation of industry specific advantages

#### Explanation of site features

#### Pricing package

#### Booking a demo

Potential users can fill in a form to get someone demonstrating and explaining how to use the system and what it does.

#### Signing up for the service

#### LogIn

A page for existing users to log in. There are two main type of users:
- managers preparing the rota and the schedules and
- staff receiving the info about their rota,

therefore users have to pre-select which group the belong to - using radio buttons on the top of the log in form.

### Features left to implement

#### Language selection

#### Social media and footer links

#### Form submission

The scope of the current project is to create the user interface with the appropriate design as per the UX, without backend support the forms can not yet be submitted.

### Technologies used

#### Bootstrap 4, Bootswatch Litera theme

#### Pixabay

As mentioned earlier at the UX section, the background image is from Pixabay. It is *Free for commercial use No attribution required.*

#### Adobe Photoshop CS5

The CUBE logo and the CUBE Solutions Ltd. (fictional company) logo were created in Photoshop.

#### Convertico.com

The browser tab icon (favicon) was converted from png by using the Convertico.com site.

#### Stack Overflow

I used Stack Overflow to fix some bugs or figure out solutions that I couldn't solve on my own.

#### W3Schools.com 

Explanations and examples at W3Schools.com helped me properly shape my code.
